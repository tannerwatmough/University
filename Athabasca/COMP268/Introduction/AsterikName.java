// EXERCISE PROMPT

// Exercise 2.1:
// Write a program that will print your initials to standard output in letters
// that are nine lines tall. Each big letter should be made up of a bunch of
// *'s.

// TEXTBOOK DISCUSSION
// This is a very simple program. It consists of nothing but a sequence of
// System.out.println statements. The hard part is designing the letters. You
// have to experiment in your text editor until you get letters that look right
// to you. Add System.out.println(" at the beginning of the first line, then
// copy-and-paste it to the beginning of each of the other lines. (You don't
// need to type it out on each line! Creative use of copy-and-paste can save you
// a lot of work.) Then add "); to the end of each line. In my program, I've
// also added a System.out.println() statement at the beginning and the end. The
// extra blank lines make the output look better.

// Don't forget that in order to have a complete program, you have to put the
// program statements in a main subroutine and put that subroutine in a public
// class. Also, the name of the file must correspond to the name of the class;
// in this case, the file must be named PrintInitials.java.

// TEXTBOOK SOLUTION

// public class PrintInitials {

// /* This program prints my initials (DJE) in big letters,
// where each letter is nine lines tall.
// */

// public static void main(String[] args) {
// System.out.println();
