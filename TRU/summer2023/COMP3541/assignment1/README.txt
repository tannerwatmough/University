These programs were run on a local Apache server using the XAMPP software bundle to run it. All development and code creation occured on a Windows 11 machine in Visual Studio Code. 

STEPS
1. If you haven't downloaded XAMPP or don't have another way to run an Apache server with a PHP interpreter, 
   you can download it here (I know instructors will have this down, but a good readme is thorough).

2. Once downloaded and installed, unzip the program files submitted for the assignment. 
3. Move the unzipped folders into the htdocs folder inside your xampp folder. 
2. Launch the XAMPP Control Panel program and click the Start button on the same line as the Apache module. MySQL is not needed for this assignment. 
3. Open your preferred web browser and navigate to http://localhost/COMP3541_A1_Tanner_Watmough/ Here you will six folders which address the six
   parts of the assignment. Click on each folder to run the corresponding portion of the assignment.
