This is Data Structures and Algorithms at Thompson Rivers University.

It covers trees (binary and multiway), heaps, stacks, and queues. 
Operations are also done on graph data structures, implementing
common algorithms for wokring with advanced data structures, and
recognizing which data strucutre is most appropriate for a paritcular
problem.
